Group 2, the Stallions

Colin Kwiecinski, Ginsu Eddy, Beneyam Mesele, Talin Hans, Kellen Maier

## Objective
Our objective is to address UN SDG 17, partnerships, by developing a webapp that will serve as a resource hub for
any Seattle residents who wish to provide aid to homelessness in Seattle.

Our first step towards achieving this will be to build a MVP for our product, a pamhplet and informational flyer generator webapp.
This webapp will have two core functionalities.

## Features
- Landing page
- Search box with filters
- Static resource pages
- Pamphlet Generator

## User Flow

Users will start at the homepage and use the homepage tiles to navigate to all other parts of the website. They can use the search bar at the top of the homepage or click the tile to access areas like pamphlets, static information pages, and map result pages.
If the user wants to access the filter options for the search function, they click the arrow to get a dropdown with filter options.
