#### Dec 1, 2021 by Beneyam

The city of Seattle has been looked at from different angles such as technology development, growth in infrastructure, and now the underlying issue with homeless. While the solution does not seem feasible due to the different moving parts, it is still important to think about where the issue originated from and where we as students can look to discover the solution.


Multiple sources have mentioned that there are a few solutions that Seattle can use to combat the current issue with homeless such as paying poor people’s rent. Poor people cannot pay their rent due to other underlying issues such as health, debt and other expenses. According to Crosscut, the website mentions that the best way to reduce this issue is to have citizens accommodate for the needs of others.

- “The vouchers work under the assumption that people shouldn’t have to pay more than 30% of their income on rent. So renters pony up their 30%, and the city tops up the rest, up to $2,217 per month for a family of three seeking a two-bedroom apartment.”

Using Crosscut’s analogy for Seattle’s case, it’s clear to see that a solution can be applied to resolve the demanding issue of homelessness. However, while the solution seems reliable and could work in the short term, it is still important to think about long-term solutions that can mitigate any forms of risks against this issue.`;
