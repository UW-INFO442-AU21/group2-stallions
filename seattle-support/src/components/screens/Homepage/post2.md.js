# What can college students do to help?

#### Dec 3, 2021 by Beneyam

Our group has taken the opportunity to study this issue and identify a few of the underlying causes towards homlessness. We don’t believe there’s just a simple solution for it, but there are ways to mitigate this cause in the near future. According to the Dept of Housing and Urban Development, homelessness in Seattle has been rising over the past decade and there are still about  4,000 individuals who are considered unsheltered and homeless.

## Underlying issues for homeless in Seattle
- Lack of resources for people that are in need
- Lack of knowledge for citizens that are willing to help

Based on our research, we discovered that not only is there a lack of knowledge for those who are willing to help but this issue has been put on the back burner for an odd reason. College students around the city of Seattle are interested in learning and figuring out how to combat this problem but seem to be confused as to where to start.

By taking the interests of college students into consideration, we have developed a tool that is able to contain various types of information that can be accessed via online and physical copies(pamphlets). Our current understanding of the problem is that there is a lack of knowledge dissemination. Seattle citizens lack substantial knowledge of how they can individually contribute to ending homelessness in the city, and the knowledge about this topic is difficult to access.

Our objective with this tool is to give those who are interested in making Seattle a better place a chance to offer assistance and help make the change. While homelessness is an unfortunate situation, we believe with the right type of information and knowledge we can help make drastic changes around our communities.
